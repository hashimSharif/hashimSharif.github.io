[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working with Vikram Adve and Sasa Misailovic in the HPVM group. In April 2021, I completed my PhD from the CS department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Vikram Adve.\nI work on compilers and systems for machine learning. I build compiler and runtime systems for end-to-end accuracy-aware optimization of tensor-based programs. A major focus of my work is on developing easy-to-use systems for compute-efficient deep learning at the edge. These systems enable significant improvements in performance and energy-efficiency of software programs by systematically trading off small amounts of computational accuracy, often with no impact on the end-to-end task quality. My earlier PhD research focuses on partial evaluation techniques for reducing code size.\n  I am on the Job Market!
