[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working with Dr. Vikram Adve and Dr. Sasa Misailovic in the HPVM group. In April 2021, I completed my PhD from the CS department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with my doctoral thesis work supervised by Dr. Vikram Adve.\nI work in the areas of compilers and program analysis. I build compiler and runtime systems for end-to-end accuracy-aware optimization of tensor-based programs. I work on techniques that improve the energy-efficiency and performance of software programs by using accuracy-aware optimizations that trade off small amounts of computational accuracy in exchange for significant performance improvements. A major focus of my work is on developing easy-to-use systems for compute-efficient deep learning at the edge. My earlier work focuses on static analysis techniques for code size reduction via software specialization.\n I will be on the academic job market this Fall! Job materials will be added soon. \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working with Dr. Vikram Adve and Dr. Sasa Misailovic in the HPVM group.
